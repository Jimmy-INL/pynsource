=========

Version number: Version 1.72 (Feb 26th 2019)

Author: Andy Bulka

Overview
--------

Reverse engineer Python source code into UML class diagrams.

Installation / Usage
--------------------

Ready to go binary apps:
 * [Mac download](http://bit.ly/pynsource-mac-1-72) (just unzip and drag into Applications) 
 * Windows _coming soon_
 * Linux _coming soon_
