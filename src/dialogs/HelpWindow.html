<h2>What is PyNSource?</h2>

<p>Import one or more python files and they will be reverse engineered and represented as a UML
    diagram.&nbsp; Layout the diagram as you like and print it to paper or to pdf.</p>
<p>For an online version of pynsource, please email <span style="text-decoration: underline;">abulka@gmail.com</span>
    and get onto the beta program.</p>
<h3>Importing Python files</h3>
<p>Import multiple files by multiple selecting files (hold ctrl and/or shift) in the file open
    dialog.</p>
<p>You can import repeatedly and incoming classes will be <strong>added</strong> and wired up to
    existing classes on the workspace.</p>
<h3>Creating new classes</h3>
<p>Whilst PyNSource is mainly a reverse engineering tool, you can delete classes add new classes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Drawing lines between classes is a bit fiddly but works in a pinch. To draw lines between
    classes:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Select the first class,</li>
    <li>hit 'q',</li>
    <li>select the second class,</li>
    <li>hit 'w' (association) or 'e' (generalisation).</li>
</ol>
<h3>Zooming</h3>
<p>Use</p>
<ul>
    <li>-&gt; (right arrow) to expand the layout spacing</li>
    <li>&lt;- (left arrow) to contract.</li>
    <li>Or use the CTRL-MouseWheel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Laying out lots of classes does better with an increased layout spacing, but takes up more
    room.</p>
<h3>Optimal Layout</h3>
<p>After a (possibly slow) 'Optimal' Layout, there may be layout variants that you can access by
    pressing keys 1, 2 ... 8 in decreasing order of layout perfection.</p>
<h3>Colour</h3>
<p>The 'colour sibling subclasses' feature helps use colour to understand the relationships in your
    uml diagram.</p>
<h3>UML as Ascii</h3>
<p>Hit "Ctrl-J" (or Cmd-J on Mac) to toggle between normal UML and Ascii UML - you can thus copy and
    paste ascii uml text into your source code!</p>
<p>Optionally use Java Ascii Versatile Editor <span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.jave.de</span>
    to wire up your ascii uml classes nicely before pasting into your source code or documentation.
</p>
<h3>Known Bugs in Mac version</h3>
<ul>
    <li>When printing, the default page range is 1-9999, you need to change the 9999 into a 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is due to a bug in the underlying wxPython GUI toolkit on Mac.</p>
