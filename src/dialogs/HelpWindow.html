<h2>What is Pynsource?</h2>
<p><img src="help-images/help01.jpg" /></p>
<p>Import one or more python files and they will be reverse engineered and represented as a UML diagram.&nbsp; Layout the diagram as you like and print it to paper or to pdf.</p>
<p><img src="help-images/pro.jpg" /> The Pro version of Pynsource, released in 2019, substitutes a faster graphics engine which allows for zoom, zoom to fit and drag drop line connection between shapes.&nbsp; Please support the Pro version so that more features can be added e.g. undo, advanced Python parsing, UML line annotations etc.</p>
<p><img src="help-images/gituml.jpg" /> For an exciting new online version of Pynsource which integrates with Github, please
    <a target="_blank" href="mailto:abulka@gmail.com?subject=GitUML beta request">email</a>
    to request to get onto the beta program.</p>
<h3>Importing Python files</h3>
<p>Import multiple files by multiple selecting files (hold ctrl and/or shift) in the file open dialog.</p>
<p>You can import repeatedly and incoming classes will be <strong>added</strong> and wired up to existing classes on the workspace.  The positions of existing classes will not be affected by new, incoming UML objects.</p>
<p>The default parsing mode is Python 3 syntax.  To switch to Python 2 syntax mode, toggle the menu item <b>"File / Python 3 mode"</b></p>
<h3>Adding classes</h3>
<p>Whilst Pynsource is mainly a reverse engineering tool, you can delete classes and add new classes.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Adding Lines</h3>
<p>You can delete or change existing association lines, as well as create new ones.</p>
<p>Drag lines directly between UML shapes. E.g. Drag between a shape's white port to any other shape's white port.</p>
<p>Change the line style through the line's r.click menu or shortcuts, like selecting the line and hitting 'R' which reverses the direction of the line.</p>
<p>Drawing lines between classes using shortcut keys is also possible: To draw lines between classes:</p>
<ol>
<p><img src="help-images/pro.jpg" /> Dragging lines directly between UML shapes is a Pro feature.</p>
<li>Select the first class,</li>
<li>hit 'q',</li>
<li>select the second class,</li>
<li>hit 'a' (association), 'w' (composition) or 'e' (generalisation).</li>
</ol>
<h3>Adding Images</h3>
<p>You can import images but currently, images will not be persisted when you save the diagram.</p>
<p>Images can be resized, and will be printed with your diagram.</p>
<h3>Zooming</h3>
Zooming will be towards the mouse position.</p>
<p>If you have a shape selected, zooming will be towards that shape.</p>
<p>Use</p>
<ul>
<li>CMD + and CMD to zoom in and out.</li>
<li>CMD 0 resets the zoom to normal scale</li>
<li>CMD MouseWheel to zoom in and out.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="help-images/pro.jpg" /> Zooming is a Pro feature.</p>
<h3>Expanding and contracting the layout</h3>
<p>Use</p>
<ul>
<li>-&gt; (right arrow) to expand the layout spacing</li>
<li>&lt;- (left arrow) to contract.</li>
</ul>
<p>Laying out lots of classes does better with an increased layout spacing, but takes up more room.</p>
<h3>Optimal Layout</h3>
<p>This runs layout several times and chooses the layout with least line crossings and the least shape overlaps.&nbsp; After an 'Optimal' Layout, there may be layout variants that you can access by pressing keys 1, 2 ... 8 in decreasing order of layout perfection.</p>
<p><img src="help-images/pro.jpg" /> Optimal Layout is a Pro feature.</p>
<h3>Colour</h3>
<p><img src="help-images/help-colour.jpg" /></p>
<p>The 'colour sibling subclasses' feature helps use colour to understand the relationships in your uml diagram.</p>
<hr />
<h3>UML as Ascii - View</h3>
<p><img src="help-images/help-ascii.jpg" /></p>
<p>Hit "Ctrl-J" (or Cmd-J on Mac) to toggle between normal UML and Ascii UML - you can thus copy and paste ascii uml text into your source code!</p>
<p>Hold down ALT as you drag select text fragments to select in "block" mode, which allows you to precisely select single classes or areas of your diagram.</p>
<p>Optionally use Java Ascii Versatile Editor <span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.jave.de</span> to wire up your ascii uml classes nicely before pasting into your source code or documentation.</p>
<hr />
<h3>PlantUML - View</h3>
<p><img src="help-images/plantuml01.jpg" /></p>
<p>The PlantUML view renders a UML diagram image using the <a target="_blank" href="http://plantuml.com/class-diagram">PlantUML web service</a>&nbsp;which requires an internet connection.</p>
<p>There is a limitation on the size of diagram which this service will render.</p>
<p>There is no ability to select and move shapes.
    You can however switch to the main UML view, where everthing is editable, then switch back to PlantUML view (the UML image will be re-rendered).</p>
<p>Printing, zooming (pro) and saving of images (pro) are available whilst in PlantUML view.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Known Bugs in Mac version</h3>
<ul>
<li>When printing, the default page range in the print dialog box appears as 1-9999. Only the one page will actually be physically printed (thankfully).</li>
<li>"Pure" full-screen on Mac is prevented due to slower performance, please limit yourself to "regular" maximised mode (hold ALT when pressing the maximise icon).</li>
</ul>
<p>These limitations are due bugs in the underlying wxPython GUI toolkit on Mac.</p>
