# Need to use a brew python (which is a proper framework installation), not a virtual env
# Not even a pyenv version of python is good enough for building via py2app (pyenv version ok for running
# in development mode).  Virtualenv python no good for either running nor deploying (cos of wxpython)

# Ensure you install py2app for the version of python you are invoking.
#   pip install py2app
# We have to use env again because we are invoking a script which then invokes some version of python.
# whatever is first in the path will win.  

cd src

# Build the setup.py file (note, cannot change the name of the output file, it must be setup.py)
$PY2APPLET --make-setup pyNsourceGui.py      # pip install py2app

echo Ensure you edit the src/setup.py as follows:
echo
echo DATA_FILES = \[\'dialogs/HelpWindow.html\', \'dialogs/help-images\' \]
echo

# Clean up your build directories
rm -rf build dist

# Now invoke the py2app
/usr/local/bin/python2 setup.py py2app      # deployment - makes a universal with 64 bit favoured.
#/usr/local/bin/python2 setup.py py2app -A     # deployment - makes a universal with 64 bit favoured.

# Hacks cos py2app doesn't copy things into the right directories.
# Also ensure you remove references to "import wx.xrc" from dialog/*.py that wxFormBuilder inserts - see https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/2295
